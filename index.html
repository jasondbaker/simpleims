<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>SimpleIMS is a Business to Business (B2B) solution for documenting and managing service 
requests. IMS’s are used in many businesses to handle requests by customers and to improve the efficiency of 
customer service organizations. </p>

<p>A company representative uses an IMS to document, prioritize, and assign a customer service issue to a staff 
member who can manage the customer request. For example, a customer might call a software company to report that 
the software application running on her desktop computer is displaying an error message. A customer service 
representative from the software company would use the IMS to document and prioritize the problem. Additionally, 
other company support staff members would perform actions to resolve the customer support issue. </p>

<p>An IMS also typically provides reports showing the number of incidents handled each month, customer representative
performance, and general incident trends. Companies can use these metrics to improve customer satisfaction and better understand their resource 
needs.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play 2 framework: <a href="http://www.playframework.com">http://www.playframework.com</a>
</li>
<li>Java IDE (Eclipse, etc)</li>
</ul><p>Installation steps:
1. Create new Play IMS project: <em>play new ims</em>
2. If using Eclipse, install the project files using: <em>play eclipse</em>
3. Install git in the ims directory: <em>git init</em>
4. Issue a pull request from the project repository to update the files.</p>

<h2>
<a name="architecture" class="anchor" href="#architecture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ARCHITECTURE</h2>

<p>The SimpleIMS system includes both a RESTful API and a Javascript-based client application. The API and the client
application both used separate model-view-controller (MVC) frameworks. The API is built around the <a href="http://www.playframework.com">Java Play 2
framework</a> and the client application is built around the <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS framework</a>. The API currently uses the Java
<a href="http://www.h2database.com">H2 database engine</a> for data persistence -- although this database could easily be switched out for any relational database
supported by the <a href="http://www.avaje.org/">EBean ORM</a>. </p>

<p>A RESTful API was developed to facilitate data transfer, in JSON format, between the client application and the 
core IMS system.  JSON was chosen because it is a lightweight object serialization format, and it works well with both 
Java and Javascript-based application frameworks. REST represents a modern approach to designing pragmatic web 
API’s where application endpoints are defined by objects acting as nouns and called by HTTP methods acting as 
verbs. By supporting dozens of useful API endpoints, the system provides an API vocabulary that allows a wide 
variety of client applications to communicate with the system. </p>

<p>Interestingly, both the presentation and domain logic application tiers utilize separate MVC frameworks. In the 
case of the domain logic tier (API), the system is primarily using the Model and Controller portions of the framework. 
The View capabilities of the Play 2 framework are only used to bootstrap the AngularJS application into the 
user’s web browser. This architecture reinforces a clear separation of concerns. The Play 2 framework is 
focused on supporting the API, whereas the AngularJS framework supports the client web interface. </p>

<p>SimpleIMS can support any kind of client interface as long as it can communicate with the RESTful API and
understand <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>. The existing AngularJS-based client interface represents a prototype of what a client
interface could look like. A client interface could just as easily have been built on a mobile platform. In fact,
that's a good idea for a future project.</p>

<p><strong>AGENTS</strong></p>

<p>Agents represent the representatives of the company providing products or services to the customers. An
agent can create, update, and own incidents.</p>
